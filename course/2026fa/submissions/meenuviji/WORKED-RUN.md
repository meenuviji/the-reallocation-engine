# WORKED-RUN — data-titles-h1b-entry

## Executive summary

**What this is.** A complete worked example of the sponsorship-by-title tool, run on sample data. It shows what went in, the exact commands, what came out, which values came from data and which from the student's own rules, and how the result was checked by hand and by tests. It is built for an international data-analytics student who will need visa sponsorship and wants to know whether an employer has sponsored entry-level data jobs, not just any job.

**Why read it.** It lets a reviewer trace every number on the page to a file or a stated rule, and see where the tool stops and asks a person.

**What it found.**
- From a fresh copy of the committed code, 15 sample postings produced 12 scored results: 2 Apply, 8 Consider, 2 Skip. 2 stopped because the company name was unknown or ambiguous, and 1 was refused because a required value was missing.
- All 28 offline tests pass.
- A hand check of one employer against the raw data matched exactly.
- Two deliberate attempts to break the tool were caught by the right check.
- Every value is either read from data or set by the student's own written rules; no model judgment is used anywhere.
- The low skip rate (17%) comes from how the sample was drawn, not from the tool being lenient.

Status is DRAFT. The reflection below is left for the student to write.

## Scenario and inputs

Run inputs, from `scripts/contrib/2026fa/meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry/run-config.json` (all labeled in that file):

| Input | Value | Label | Why (from the file) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `target_titles` | Data Analyst, Business Intelligence Analyst, Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, AI Engineer | your-input | CHANGE-BRIEF §1 target families. Used for BLS wage context only. |
| `as_of` | 2026-10-03 | your-input | the real run date |
| `opt_start` | 2027-02-01 | your-input | earliest of my expected Feb-Mar 2027 OPT start; earlier start = stricter window |
| `window_days` | 90 | your-input | post-completion OPT unemployment allowance; regulatory figure, not from repo data; verify with DSO |
| `hiring_lag_days` | 60 | your-input | my assumption, not measured |

The file holds run inputs only, with no name, contact or résumé content. No real personal data is used anywhere in this run.

Sample postings, from `scripts/contrib/2026fa/meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry/postings/sample-postings.json`, built once by `scripts/contrib/2026fa/meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry/build_sample.py`. The draw uses seed 42 and 2 companies per evidence group, in the order no-record, no-data-title, proven, entry-under-min-approvals, only-mid, only-senior. There are 15 postings in total: 12 seeded draws, plus 3 fixed postings added only to exercise failure cases. Posting titles are fictional, URLs are `jobs.example.com`, and company names are real employer names from the CSV. Every posting uses fit 0.5, labeled your-input with the reason "held constant to isolate the sponsorship signal". The 14 that carry a liveness value use 1.0, labeled your-input with `determined_by` "assumed, not checked".

Evidence-group sizes in the CSV (record, `_meta.group_sizes`): no-record 28812, no-data-title 1309, proven 99, entry-under-min-approvals 41, only-mid 14, only-senior 94 (total 30369).

## Verification

### (a) Hand cross-check of ROKU INC against the raw CSV — run by Meena

Quoted from `course/2026fa/submissions/meenuviji/recon/hand-checks.txt` (Meena's own Terminal checks):

~~~text
  1  === Hand checks run by Meena, 2026-10-03T18:48:56Z ===

~~~

Recorded in `out/run.json` for s11 (ROKU INC): approvals 654.0, denials 4.0, rate 99.3920972644377, median 182155.0, titles ['Senior Software Engineer', 'Senior Data Scientist', 'Software Engineer', 'Product Manager', 'Senior Data Engineer']. These are the same values as the hand check.

### (b) Tests

All 28 offline tests pass in the fresh clone (full `-v` output in "Commands and output" above). Each failure case in CHANGE-BRIEF §8, and each Revision 1 timeline case, is mapped to its test in TEST-REPORT.md, "Failure cases exercised".

### (c) Deliberate break attempts — run by Meena

Quoted from `recon/hand-checks.txt`. Break 1 misspells ROKU as `R0KU` (zero for O). Break 2 removes ROKU's liveness value:

### (d) Why the skip rate is 17%

2 of 12 scored postings are Skip (16.7%, `out/run.json` → `counts`), well below the 50% DOMAIN.md calls healthy. The cause is the sample design, not the tool. The sample is stratified at 2 postings per evidence group, so each of the six groups carries equal weight. But 28812 of 30369 CSV companies (94.9%) are in the no-record group, and that is the only group that scores Skip at fit 0.5: the sponsorship vote is dropped, so the composite is 0.5 × 0.3 = 0.150, below the 0.20 Consider floor (`out/report.md`). A sample drawn in proportion to the CSV would be mostly no-record postings and would skip far more often. The report states this as "The sample is stratified (2 per group), so its skip rate is not representative."

## Reflection

Written by Meena (meenuviji)

**What worked.** I am most confident in keeping the evidence checks separate from the final decision. Instead of assuming that a company is a good target just because it appears in the sponsorship data, the prototype checks the available evidence and stops when something important is missing or ambiguous. This makes the result easier to trace and prevents the prototype from presenting an assumption as a verified fact.

**What surprised me / what was missed.** The correction that surprised me most was the duplicate evidence for PATHAI/PATHRAI. I initially thought a company-name match would be straightforward, but small differences in company names can point to duplicate or ambiguous records. It showed me that finding a row is not enough; I also need to verify that it is actually the right company before using its sponsorship history.

**One concrete next improvement.** The first improvement I would build is better company identity matching. I would add normalization and additional checks such as location or other company identifiers so that similar company names do not automatically get treated as the same employer. If the evidence is still ambiguous, the prototype should stop and ask for human review rather than choosing automatically. Location alone would not have caught PATHAI/PATHRAI, since their cities differ; that case needs the CSV-wide duplicate-evidence scan listed as [TODO: DEV] #6 in the recipe, or a real company identifier, which the 80 Days CSV does not carry.

Facts available for the reflection (from the record, not my words):

- **Timeline rule.** The original §7 rule treated a projected start before `opt_start` as a failure. That would have gated every role for a pre-OPT student applying months ahead, and was found when the build needed an artificial future `as_of`. It was corrected in CHANGE-BRIEF Revision 1 (commit 47a5b79): an early start is now a deferred start (noted, factor 1.0).
- **Sampling per tier.** The first sample drew 2 companies per sponsorship tier. Thin-evidence (fewer than 5 approvals) and only-mid companies were folded into the same tier as other cases. Drawing per evidence group (six groups) made them visible.
- **All non-Skip groups landed in Consider.** In the default run, 8 of 12 scored postings are Consider across four different evidence groups (`out/report.md`). Per-group next actions now tell those groups apart; the scorer's recommendations themselves are unchanged.
- **Headline counts fell under the stricter allowlist.** Under the final rules: 248 / 94 / 39, against 421 / 171 / 68 under the probe's substring rule (CHANGE-BRIEF Revision 2; `recon/recipe-path-check.md`).
- **Duplicate evidence.** `PATHAI INC` (Cambridge, MA) and `PATHRAI INC` (Mountain View, CA) carry identical sponsorship records (`out/report.md`). *Inference about cause, not verified:* `data/80-days-to-stay/80-days-day-08/README.md` line 21 says the original SEC-to-LCA join used fuzzy matching with RapidFuzz, which could attach one employer's record to a similar name.
- **Status claim.** The recipe was drafted as RUNNABLE-SAMPLE and changed to DRAFT before commit, under SNICKERDOODLE.md's lifecycle rules (7 open TODO items). It was committed as DRAFT in 4a4074e.

### Broke during testing, fixed

- **CHANGE-BRIEF formatting.** Failed: Markdown formatting was lost in copy-paste in the first commit (53cc80a). Changed: formatting restored, content unchanged. Where: 3f1182e.
- **Timeline rule.** Failed: a projected start before `opt_start` counted as a failure, so every pre-OPT role would be gated and the build needed an artificial future `as_of`. Changed: early starts became deferred starts (factor 1.0, non-scoring note); only a start after `window_end` fails. Where: CHANGE-BRIEF Revision 1 (47a5b79); code and tests in the prototype commit (e93e817).
- **Sibling-note test assertion.** Failed: `test_exact_match_with_siblings_is_noted_not_stopped` asserted exactly one note in the whole run, and the new deferred-start notes made the count 2. Changed: it now asserts exactly one note of type `sibling-rows` and checks that note's text. This is the same check limited to the note type it was written for, not a loosening. Where: `scripts/contrib/2026fa/meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry/tests/test_pipeline.py` (in e93e817).
- **Sampling.** Failed: drawing 2 companies per sponsorship tier folded the thin-evidence and only-mid cases into other tiers. Changed: draw 2 per evidence group (six groups). Where: `scripts/contrib/2026fa/meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry/build_sample.py` and `rules.json` → `sample` (in e93e817).
- **Status claim.** Failed: the recipe was drafted as RUNNABLE-SAMPLE with 7 open TODOs and no logged gate, against SNICKERDOODLE.md's lifecycle rules. Changed: status DRAFT. Where: committed as DRAFT in 4a4074e.
- **PII scan finding.** Failed: `node scripts/pii-scan.mjs` exits 1 on the full tree. Traced: the finding is in `package-lock.json` line 606 on origin/main, a file this branch does not change, and `--diff origin/main` is clean. Nothing was changed. Where: TEST-REPORT.md, "PII scan".
