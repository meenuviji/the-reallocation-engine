# TEST-REPORT — data-titles-h1b-entry (fresh-clone test)

## Executive summary

**What this is.** A test of the sponsorship-by-title tool, run from a fresh copy of the committed branch rather than the working folder. It checks that the tool runs for anyone who clones the branch, not just on the machine where it was built.

**Why read it.** It shows what passes and what fails, the full unedited output of every check, and which decisions are still left to a person.

**What it found.** Almost everything passed on a clean copy:
- The standard setup checks pass before and after the run.
- The sample run finishes with exit 3, "completed with stops", as designed: 12 of 15 postings scored (2 Apply, 8 Consider, 2 Skip), 2 stopped at the company-name check, 1 refused for a missing value.
- All 28 offline tests pass.
- The syntax checks pass for the tool and the recipe.
- The branch touches only the student's own folders.

Three things need attention:
- **The privacy scan of the working tree reports one finding and exits 1.** It is a third-party email address inside a package-lock file that comes from the main branch; this branch never touches that file. The branch-only scan is clean.
- **Running the tool changes two committed output files.** Only their run timestamp changes, but the tracked copies go stale every run.
- **Nothing here clears a human gate.** The stops, refusals and notes listed at the end still need a person.

Nothing in this report was fixed. One string was redacted from the pasted output (see the PII scan section).

## Environment and clone SHA

- Clone: `/tmp/fresh-reallocation` (did not exist beforehand), cloned from the working repo's committed branch `contrib/2026fa-meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry`.
- Clone HEAD: `4a4074e607ba154ca6edf63de816b6f7b9fe49a1`.
- The clone has no local `main` branch, only `origin/main`, which points at the working repo's `main`. The scope check therefore uses `git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD`.
- Commands were run through a wrapper that prints a UTC timestamp, the command, all of stdout+stderr, and the exit code.

# Sponsorship-by-title run report

## Executive summary

**What this is.** The result of checking 15 sample job postings against each employer's history of visa-sponsored job titles, to see whether the employer has sponsored *entry-level data* jobs before — not just any job — and passing that judgment to the project's existing role scorer.

**Why read it.** It shows which postings are worth tailoring an application for, which were stopped before scoring and why, and exactly which evidence and which of your own rules produced each recommendation.

**What it found.** 12 postings were scored: **2 Apply, 8 Consider, 2 Skip** (skip rate 17% of scored; the engine treats at least 50% as healthy). 2 stopped because the company name could not be matched to exactly one employer in the data; a person has to resolve these. 1 were refused because a required date or posting-status value was missing; the scorer would otherwise have silently assumed the best case. 2 scored posting(s) are at employers with no sponsorship record at all. No record is not evidence that they don't sponsor. All of the 12 scored postings would need the employer to accept a start 61 days after the offer, because work authorization begins later; that is noted, not penalized. For 7 scored posting(s), the employer has sponsored data jobs, but not this kind of data job, so the match is at company level only. PATHAI INC and PATHRAI INC carry identical sponsorship evidence; it may belong to only one of them.

**How the sample relates to all employers in the data.** Share of all employers in each group: no sponsorship record 94.9%; sponsor, but no data titles 4.3%; entry-level data title and enough approvals 0.33%; entry-level data title but few approvals 0.14%; only mid-level data titles 0.05%; only senior data titles 0.31%.

The sample is stratified (2 per group), so its skip rate is not representative; 94.9% of CSV companies are in the no-record group.

The sponsorship scores are ordered labels from your own rules, not probabilities. Fit and posting status were not measured in this sample: fit is held constant and every posting is assumed live. The next action for each posting is advice from your own rules; it never changes the recommendation.

## Sample by evidence group

| Evidence group | Companies in CSV (record) | Sample postings scored |
|---|---|---|
| no-record | 28812 | RELATIONSHIP SCIENCE LLC (Skip); BLUE OWL CAPITAL INC (Skip) |
| no-data-title | 1309 | AKOYA BIOSCIENCES INC (Consider); IMMUNITYBIO INC (Consider) |
| proven | 99 | ENTRUPY INC (Apply); DISQO INC (Apply) |
| entry-under-min-approvals | 41 | CARGO CHIEF ACQUISITION INC (Consider); BIOME ANALYTICS INC (Consider) |
| only-mid | 14 | PATHAI INC (Consider); PATHRAI INC (Consider) |
| only-senior | 94 | ROKU INC (Consider); CAMBRIDGE MOBILE TELEMATICS INC (Consider) |

## Stopped at the company-match gate

A person must pick the right row or confirm the company is not in the data. Nothing was guessed.

| Posting | Input name | Reason | Candidates (name, city, state) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Data Analyst I | Quillfeather Data Labs, Inc. | no-match | — |
| Associate Data Scientist | Arcturus Therapeutics | more-than-one-row | ARCTURUS THERAPEUTICS INC (SAN DIEGO, CA); ARCTURUS THERAPEUTICS LTD (SAN DIEGO, CA) |

## Refused: missing gate value

These were never sent to the scorer, because it treats a missing value as the best case (1.0).

| Posting | Employer | Missing |
|---|---|---|
| Junior Data Engineer | CENTIFIC GLOBAL SOLUTIONS INC | liveness.factor missing or not numeric |

## Caveats

- A title with no level marker is counted as entry-or-unmarked. Unmarked is not proof of entry level.
- Sponsorship data is per company; the sponsored-title list is the only role-level signal, and it is a short list of free text.
- Approval rate measures how often filed petitions were approved, not whether this employer will file for you.
- Wage context is the national median for the matching occupation title only; it does not affect scoring.
- A company-level data-family match does not show the employer sponsored the specific posting title.

Paths outside the three namespaces (`scripts/contrib/2026fa/meenuviji-*`, `recipes/cases/2026fa/meenuviji-*`, `course/2026fa/submissions/meenuviji/`): **none** (41 paths checked from `--name-only`).

## Tracked-file side effects of running run.py

Yes: `run.py` modified two tracked files. `git status --short` was empty before the run. After the run, `out/report.md` and `out/run.json` show as modified. The diff below shows the only change in each is the run timestamp (`run_id` / "Run:" line). The four other files under `out/` (`roles.json`, `score/role-scores.json`, `score/role-scores.md`) were rewritten with byte-identical content. Not fixed.

## PII scan

Required command, working-tree mode. **Exit 1, one finding.** One alteration was made to the pasted output: the email address in the finding is replaced by `<redacted: third-party address from glob's npm deprecation notice; package-lock.json line 606>`. Pasting it verbatim would add a new email finding inside this submission folder.

~~~text
[2026-10-03T18:44:31Z] $ node scripts/pii-scan.mjs
pii-scan: 1 finding(s) — see DATA_CONTRACT.md §Zero-Conditions

  [email] package-lock.json — <redacted: third-party address from glob's npm deprecation notice; package-lock.json line 606>

If a finding is a false positive (fictional data outside the sanctioned dirs),
move it under search/examples/ or resumes/ rather than allowlisting it here.
[exit code: 1]

Supplementary, read-only, not requested. The scanner's header (pasted below) documents a `--diff <base>` mode that scans the branch's own history. It is clean, and the finding's source line is already on `origin/main`:

## What the gates require a human to judge

From the recipe's phase gates (`recipes/cases/2026fa/meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry.md`). The run stops or notes these; it does not decide them:

- **Company-match stops (G1).**
  - `Quillfeather Data Labs, Inc.` (no match): confirm whether the company is really not in the data.
  - `Arcturus Therapeutics` (two rows, INC and LTD, both San Diego): pick the right row or confirm neither.
- **Refused missing gate values (G2).** The `CENTIFIC GLOBAL SOLUTIONS INC` posting has no liveness value. Supply one (checked live, with a date) or leave it refused. The scorer would otherwise have treated it as 1.0.
- **Timeline arithmetic (G4).** Check the inputs behind `projected_start = as_of 2026-10-03 + hiring_lag_days 60 = 2026-12-02` and `window_end = 2027-05-02`. All are your-input; `hiring_lag_days` is an assumption and `window_days` is a regulatory figure to verify with the DSO.
- **Deferred-start acceptance.** All 12 scored postings carry "employer must accept a start 61 days after offer". Whether each employer accepts that is unknown and is not scored.
- **Duplicate-evidence notes.** `PATHAI INC` and `PATHRAI INC` carry identical sponsorship records. Decide which employer, if either, the evidence belongs to before acting on either posting.
