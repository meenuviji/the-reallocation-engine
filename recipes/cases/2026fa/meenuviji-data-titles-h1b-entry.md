# data-titles-h1b-entry — sponsored-title evidence for entry-level data roles

## Executive summary

**What it does.** Many employers have sponsored work visas before, but a new graduate needs to know whether an employer has sponsored *entry-level data jobs*. This recipe reads each employer's list of past sponsored job titles and keeps only data-family titles (data analyst, data engineer, data scientist, business intelligence, machine learning or AI engineer). It sorts those titles into senior, mid, or entry/unmarked, and turns the result into a sponsorship score using the student's own written rules. It then hands that score, unchanged, to the project's existing recommendation engine, which returns Apply, Consider or Skip.

**Who it is for.** An international MS Data Analytics student on an F-1 visa, not yet on OPT, applying for entry-level data-family roles, who will need an employer willing to file an H-1B later.

**What it decides.**
- For each posting, it decides whether the employer's sponsorship history supports applying, networking first, or skipping, and what to do next.
- It never guesses an employer: an unknown or ambiguous name stops for a person.
- It never sends a posting with a missing date or posting status to the scorer, which would silently assume the best case.
- A company with no sponsorship record is treated as unknown, not as a non-sponsor.

**Handoff condition (done when).** A sample run is complete when all of the following hold:
- The single command exits 0 or 3.
- Both outputs are written.
- Every scored posting in the agent log carries a source label on every value.
- Every company-match stop and every refusal is listed in both outputs.
- The offline test suite passes.

"Looks right" is not the condition.

Status is DRAFT under SNICKERDOODLE.md's lifecycle rules because seven open TODO items remain (six proposed additions and one human approval gate); the prototype itself runs end to end on sample data with 28 offline tests (scripts/contrib/2026fa/meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry/).

## Purpose and source inventory

### Required reads (in order)

1. `SNICKERDOODLE.md` — gates, provenance, lifecycle.
2. `DOMAIN.md` — layout and known gaps.
3. `course/2026fa/submissions/meenuviji/CHANGE-BRIEF.md` — the spec, including Revision 1 (corrected timeline rule).
4. `scripts/contrib/2026fa/meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry/README.md` — rules, files, known gaps.
5. This recipe, then `recipes/cases/2026fa/meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry.card.md`.

### Sources

| Source | Path | Label | Human check |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sponsorship history (80 Days to Stay) | `data/80-days-to-stay/80-days-csv/mapped_student_employment_targets_v3.csv` | record | SHA-256 must equal `eccdee2addf472b1639269f42eec693b083b7ce251347d5fd0b2856cfdae6270`, the hash recorded for `SEC_DOL_H1b_data_mapped.csv` in `data/80-days-to-stay/data/SEC_DOL_H1b_data_mapped-audit.md`. The run checks this and stops on mismatch. |
| National wage context | `data/bls/compact/soc_occupation_compact.csv` | record | Context only; not scored. |
| Legal-suffix list for name matching | `scripts/sec/sec-all-quarters.py` (`COMPANY_SUFFIXES`, read with `ast`, not executed) | record | Same list and order as the repo's Form D normalizer. |
| Rules (allowlist, seniority tokens, approvals cutoff, tier precedence, p values, next actions, timeline factors, sample seed) | `scripts/contrib/2026fa/meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry/rules.json` | your-input | Every entry carries `label`; an unlabeled rule stops the run. |
| Run inputs (target titles, `as_of`, `opt_start`, `window_days`, `hiring_lag_days`) | `scripts/contrib/2026fa/meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry/run-config.json` | your-input | Run inputs only: no name, contact, or résumé content. |
| Sample postings (fictional titles, real CSV company names) | `scripts/contrib/2026fa/meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry/postings/sample-postings.json` | your-input | Frozen; `scripts/contrib/2026fa/meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry/build_sample.py` refuses to overwrite without `--force`. |
| Scorer (unmodified) | `scripts/score/role-scorer.mjs` via `npm run score` | record (its output) | Never copied or re-implemented. |

### Commands

Paths written as `out/…` or `postings/…` in this recipe are relative to `scripts/contrib/2026fa/meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry/`.

Run (from repo root, no arguments; exit 0 clean, 3 completed with stops, 1 whole-run failure, 2 bad arguments):

```bash
python3 scripts/contrib/2026fa/meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry/run.py
```

Offline tests (uses the real CSVs and the real scorer; writes only to temp directories):

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/contrib/2026fa/meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry/tests -v
```

Conformance on the prototype folder:

```bash
node scripts/conformance.mjs scripts/contrib/2026fa/meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry/
```

Repo checks before any push:

```bash
npm run verify
```

```bash
npm run doctor
```

Rebuild the frozen sample (only if you mean to break the freeze):

```bash
python3 scripts/contrib/2026fa/meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry/build_sample.py --force
```

## Proposed additions (not built)

Each one is a declared gap, not a hidden one.

1. **Title- or SOC-level sponsorship records.** `[TODO: DATA SOURCE]` DOL LCA disclosure data (employer, job title, SOC code, wage, dates), ingested by a maintained script. Why: the CSV records sponsorship per company. The sponsored-title list is the only role-level signal, and it is short free text. Records per title would replace the title-list heuristic with records.
2. **A title → SOC map for target and posting titles.** `[TODO: DEFINE]` a `your-input` mapping from each target title to one SOC code, with a sentence of reasoning per row. Why: under the current rule only Data Scientist and Business Intelligence Analyst match a BLS `title`. Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer and AI Engineer show "no SOC row" (`out/report.md`, BLS column).
3. **A role-quality weight.** `[TODO: DEV]` A proposal to the scorer's maintainers for a non-zero `role_quality` weight, with renormalisation. Why: `role_quality` is 0.0 (scorer `CONFIG`, recorded in `out/run.json` → `scorer.config`), so wage context cannot change any recommendation. Blocker noted in CHANGE-BRIEF §5f: 15-2051 gives Data Scientists and Business Intelligence Analysts the same median ($112,590), so the national wage can't separate two of the target titles.
4. **Live liveness for real postings.** `[TODO: DEV]` Feed `npm run ats:liveness -- <url>` output into the posting's `liveness` field, labeled `record` with the check date. Why: in the sample every posting's liveness is `your-input`, `determined_by: "assumed, not checked"`, so the liveness gate never closes in the default run.
5. **Fit from the student's own rating.** `[TODO: DEFINE]` Replace the constant fit of 0.5 (held constant to isolate the sponsorship signal) with a per-posting rating and a written rubric.
6. **Duplicate-entity check across the whole CSV.** `[TODO: DEV]` Today the duplicate-evidence note only compares companies matched in the same run.

---

## Phase gates (hard stops)

Liveness and timeline are **gates, not votes**: the scorer multiplies by them, so a closed gate zeroes the composite whatever the votes say (`scripts/score/role-scorer.mjs`, `Composite = (Σ vote·weight) × liveness × timeline`). The scorer silently treats a *missing* gate as 1.0, so this recipe refuses the role before it reaches the scorer.

| Gate | Testable condition | Pass | Fail (role stops; run continues; exit 3) | Human sees, to clear it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| G1 Company match | Input name matches one CSV row, either exactly (upper-case) or by normalized name | continue; rule named (`exact-upper-case` / `normalized`) | `no-match` or `more-than-one-row`; never a nearest-name guess | Input name and candidate rows (name, city, state only) in `out/report.md` → "Stopped at the company-match gate"; pick a row or confirm "not in data" |
| G2 Missing gate value | `liveness.factor` numeric with a label, and all of `as_of`, `opt_start`, `window_days`, `hiring_lag_days` present | role written to `out/roles.json` | refused; never written to `out/roles.json`; the missing field is named | `out/report.md` → "Refused: missing gate value" |
| G3 Liveness (gate) | `liveness.factor` > 0.05 (the scorer's `gate_zero`) | multiplier passed to scorer | scorer returns Skip, `gated: liveness`; next action "Skip: liveness closed." | How liveness was determined (`determined_by`) |
| G4 Timeline (gate, Revision 1) | `projected_start = as_of + hiring_lag_days`; `window_end = opt_start + window_days` (inclusive); `projected_start <= window_end` | factor 1.0; if `projected_start < opt_start`, a non-scoring note: "deferred start: employer must accept a start N days after offer" | factor 0.0 → scorer Skip, `gated: timeline`; next action "Skip: timeline closed." | The arithmetic string, shown in `out/report.md` |

Whole-run failures (exit 1, no `out/report.md`, the reason is recorded in `out/run.json`):
- a missing or changed sponsorship CSV (SHA-256 mismatch);
- missing required columns;
- an unlabeled or missing rule in `scripts/contrib/2026fa/meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry/rules.json`;
- unparseable postings;
- a sponsored-title list that does not parse for a matched company;
- npm or scorer failure;
- scorer output whose role ids differ from the roles sent.

Gate decisions by a named human are not yet logged anywhere. `logs/gate-decisions/` does not exist. `[TODO: APPROVE]` Record the first human clearance of a sample run in a `logs/runs/` entry (template below), with name and date.

## What it can and cannot verify

### Can verify

#### Records quoted as-is (record)

- Whether an employer name resolves to exactly one row of the 80 Days CSV, and by which rule.
- The employer's recorded approvals, denials, approval rate, median salary and sponsored-title list, quoted from the CSV.
- That the scorer received exactly the roles that passed the gates, and what it returned, term by term.
- Whether two employers **matched within the same run** carry identical sponsorship columns. The recipe does not scan the whole CSV for duplicate evidence.

#### Your-input rules applied consistently (your-input, covered by tests)

- Which sponsored titles contain a data-family phrase from the allowlist, and which seniority bucket each falls in under the stated token rules. The tests in `scripts/contrib/2026fa/meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry/tests/test_pipeline.py` cover:
  - level tokens;
  - whole-word seniority;
  - entry markers;
  - allowlist precision;
  - evidence groups;
  - tier and p;
  - next action.
- A rule applied consistently is not a rule shown to be correct.

### Cannot verify

- **Recency.** The CSV's approval and denial counts carry no year or date range:
  - The CSV header's only date-like columns are `year_incorporated`, `company_age_years` and `latest_funding_date`, and none of them describes the sponsorship counts.
  - `data/80-days-to-stay/data/README.md` lines 50–51 define them only as "Count of approved H-1B petitions" and "Count of denied H-1B petitions".
  - `data/80-days-to-stay/README.md` line 13 names the sources (DOL LCA Disclosure Data, USCIS H-1B Employer Data Hub) without years.
  - The year table in `data/80-days-to-stay/data/SEC_DOL_H1b_data_mapped-audit.md` is headed "Funding Dates by Year", so it covers funding dates, not approvals.
  - `data/80-days-to-stay/80-days-day-08/README.md` line 24 lists "`total_h1b_filings` (Last 3 years)" in a planned schema, but no such column exists in the CSV, so it does not date these counts.

  An employer with many approvals may have stopped sponsoring.
- **Accuracy of the CSV against primary sources.** The SHA-256 check confirms the file matches the audited file, not that it matches DOL or USCIS records. No cross-check against primary data was done. `data/80-days-to-stay/data/SEC_DOL_H1b_data_mapped-join-validation-audit.md` line 10 states the raw DOL/LCA and USCIS records are not in the repository.
- **Employer identity.** A name match may not be the posting's actual employer. Subsidiaries, DBAs, and staffing or consulting firms where the agency is the sponsor all break the link. `data/80-days-to-stay/80-days-day-08/README.md` line 21 describes the original SEC-to-LCA join as fuzzy matching ("Use the `RapidFuzz` library").
- **Timeline inputs.**
  - `hiring_lag_days` is my assumption.
  - `window_days` is a regulatory figure that isn't present in repo data.
  - Whether an employer accepts a deferred start is unknown.
  - EAD timing is not modeled.
- **Next actions.** They are my advice (your-input), not validated outcomes.
- **Live liveness.** `npm run ats:liveness` is optional and untested in this recipe.
- **Role-level sponsorship.** The CSV records sponsorship per company, not per role or SOC code (REALITY-REPORT §5a: no SOC column; 1,557 of 30,369 rows have any sponsorship data).
- **Completeness of the title list.** `top_job_titles_sponsored` is short free text: 1 to 14 titles per company (PROBE-REPORT §A2). Titles the employer sponsored but that aren't in the list are invisible, and reordered titles such as "Analyst, Data" are missed by the allowlist.
- **That "unmarked" means entry level.** A title with no level marker, such as "Data Scientist", is bucketed entry-or-unmarked. Many such roles expect experience.
- **Likelihood of filing.** Approval rate measures how often *filed* petitions were approved. It says nothing about whether this employer will file for this student. No record is not evidence of non-sponsorship.
- **Posting liveness.** It is assumed in the sample (`determined_by: "assumed, not checked"`, `out/run.json`).
- **Fit.** It is held constant at 0.5 for every sample posting, labeled `your-input` and not measured.
- **Local or employer-specific pay.** BLS context is the national OEWS median only (`oews_year` 2024).
  - Of the 6 **target titles** in `scripts/contrib/2026fa/meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry/run-config.json` → `target_titles`, only 2 match a BLS `title` row by case-insensitive substring: Business Intelligence Analyst → 15-2051.01, and Data Scientist → 15-2051.00.
  - Both have the same national median, $112,590.
  - Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer and AI Engineer show "no SOC row" (`out/report.md`, BLS context column).
  - The match uses the target titles, not the 11 data-family allowlist phrases in `scripts/contrib/2026fa/meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry/rules.json`.
- **Which entity owns duplicated evidence.** `PATHAI INC` (Cambridge, MA) and `PATHRAI INC` (Mountain View, CA) carry identical sponsorship columns: 78 approvals, 2 denials, 97.5% rate, $145,600 median and the same title list (`out/report.md`, duplicate-evidence note). The evidence may belong to only one of them, and the recipe cannot tell which.
- **That the employer sponsored the posting's exact title.** A data-family match is at company level. Example: `ENTRUPY INC` lands in the proven group on a single sponsored data title, `Data Engineer`, while the sample posting there is `Machine Learning Engineer I` (`out/report.md`, title-family note).

## Output contract

### Agent log — `scripts/contrib/2026fa/meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry/out/run.json`

Top-level keys (from the current `out/run.json`): `workflow`, `run_id`, `mode`, `inputs`, `rules`, `run_config`, `data` (CSV path, SHA-256, row counts, suffix patterns), `sample` (seed, per_group, group order, group sizes), `roles_json`, `scorer` (command, exit code, captured stdout/stderr, scorer config), `status`, `exit_code`, `counts`, `evidence_group_counts_scored`, `scored`, `stops`, `refusals`, `notes`.

Each `scored[]` entry holds:
- `company_match`, `sponsorship_evidence` and `bls_context`, labeled record;
- `title_classification`, `sponsorship_term`, `evidence_group`, `fit`, `timeline` and `next_action`, labeled your-input;
- `liveness`, labeled with its own label plus `determined_by`;
- `scorer_result`, labeled record, which is the scorer's output with its own trace labels;
- `notes`, which are non-scoring (deferred-start, title-family, sibling-rows, duplicate-evidence).

Every value carries `{value, label}` with label ∈ `record` / `your-input` / `model-judgment`.

The scorer's own files are written beside it: `out/roles.json` (the input sent) and `out/score/role-scores.json` + `out/score/role-scores.md`.

### Human report — `scripts/contrib/2026fa/meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry/out/report.md`

The report has these sections, in order:
1. A plain-language executive summary, which includes the population share of each evidence group and the stratified-sample warning.
2. The run record.
3. The scored-postings table: posting, employer, recommendation, composite, evidence group, next action, tier · p, evidence, timeline, BLS context.
4. A "why each one scored as it did" block per posting.
5. Sample by evidence group.
6. Stopped at the company-match gate.
7. Refused: missing gate value.
8. Caveats.

**Reader:** the student. **Decision it enables:** where to spend tomorrow's application and networking hours.

### Why one file cannot serve both

The log must be complete and machine-checkable. Every value is labeled, the scorer's raw stdout is kept, and the deferred-start note repeats for every role. A person cannot read that. The report must be read in a few minutes, so it states the deferred start once, translates group names into plain language, and leaves out the raw stdout. That makes it unfit for a machine check (SNICKERDOODLE P5).

---

## Stop conditions and next action per result

Stop and do not invent a value when:
- a company does not resolve to exactly one row (G1);
- a gate value is missing (G2);
- the CSV hash does not match;
- a rule is unlabeled;
- asked to infer sponsorship for a company with no record;
- asked to fill a missing liveness value with 1.0;
- asked to map a title to a SOC code by guess.

Next actions are advice from `scripts/contrib/2026fa/meenuviji-data-titles-h1b-entry/rules.json` → `next_action` (your-input). They never change the scorer's recommendation. If the scorer's recommendation is Skip because a gate closed, the gate action applies; otherwise the action is chosen by evidence group. Each maps onto the book's 3-3-2 day (`book/chapters/02-the-reallocation-principle.md`: two hours applying, three hours networking, three hours portfolio):

| Result | Next action (verbatim from the rules file) | 3-3-2 time |
|---|---|---|
| Skip, gate closed | "Skip: {gate} closed." (`{gate}` = `liveness` or `timeline`) | none on this posting; hours go back to the other two blocks |
| proven | "Tailor an application (research-and-apply hours)." | research-and-apply hours |
| entry-under-min-approvals | "Thin evidence (fewer than the minimum approvals). Confirm sponsorship with a recruiter or employee before tailoring." | networking hours first; apply hours only after confirmation |
| only-mid | "They sponsor data roles at mid level. Network: ask whether they hire and sponsor new grads into this team." | networking hours |
| only-senior | "They sponsor only senior data roles. Network, don't apply cold: ask about entry-level sponsorship before tailoring." | networking hours |
| no-data-title | "They sponsor, but not data roles. Low priority: network only through a warm contact." | networking hours, warm contacts only |
| no-record | "No record is not evidence of non-sponsorship. Verify sponsorship through networking before tailoring." | networking hours |

In the current sample run, 2 Apply, 8 Consider and 2 Skip, so the skip rate is 17% of scored (`out/run.json` → `counts`). That is below the 50% DOMAIN.md calls healthy. The sample is stratified at 2 per evidence group, while 94.9% of CSV companies are in the no-record group (`out/report.md`), so the sample's skip rate is not representative.

## Facts that bite

### Known gaps from the assignment, and how each applies here

| Gap | Applies? | How |
|---|---|---|
| `role_quality` weight is 0.0 | Yes | BLS wage context is shown but cannot move a recommendation. Proposed addition 3. |
| `bls:local-wage` feeds nothing | Yes, by design | Not used. National OEWS only (CHANGE-BRIEF §6). |
| Only SEC Form D samples ship | Yes | `data/sec/form-d/` holds only `data/sec/form-d/processed/` (four 50-record samples in `data/sec/form-d/processed/sample/` plus `data/sec/form-d/processed/recent-sec-quarters-audit.md`). Form D is excluded: 128 of 200 sample records are pooled investment funds, and only 14 names match the 80 Days CSV after normalization, 1 of them (Databricks) with sponsorship data (PROBE-REPORT §C). |
| `data/raw/`, `data/verified/`, `logs/gate-decisions/` do not exist | Yes | Confirmed absent. This recipe writes only to its own `out/` folder and points at no planned directory. Gate clearances go to a `logs/runs/` entry (see the approval item under Phase gates). |
| The `snickerdoodle` CLI is roadmap | Yes | No CLI commands are given here. The agent runs the Python command and stops at each gate (DOMAIN.md, Runtime). |
| All recipes DRAFT | Partly | `npm run doctor` currently reports DRAFT 28 · RUNNABLE-SAMPLE 4 · VERIFIED 1 (`course/2026fa/submissions/meenuviji/recon/raw-output.txt`, Phase 0). |
| `bls:local-wage` fails without `.venv` | Not used | `scripts/bls/local-wage-adjustment.py` stops with "missing .venv" when `.venv` is absent (it is absent in this clone). |
| `scripts/sec/validate-h1b-join-sample.py` needs full data | Not used | Its default input is `data/80-days-to-stay/data/SEC_DOL_H1b_data_mapped.csv`, which does not exist here, and it writes an audit next to its input. Not run. |

### Gaps found during this work

| Gap | Effect on this recipe |
|---|---|
| `SEC_DOL_H1b_data_mapped.csv` is missing; recipes and `data/80-days-to-stay/data/README.md` still name it | The `_v3` CSV is used instead. Its SHA-256 equals the one recorded for the missing file, and the run enforces it. |
| `applyProfile` zeroes the sponsorship weight when `authorization` contains "authorized" (`scripts/score/role-scorer.mjs`, `applyProfile`) | No `--profile` is passed, so the scorer defaults to "needs sponsorship". `search/examples/README.md` describes a fix (PR #37) that is not in this scorer. |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` says harnesses may import `CONFIG, SRC, applyProfile, scoreRole`; the scorer exports nothing | The CLI and `out/score/role-scores.json` are used instead. |
| `npm run verify` prints "private path not gitignored" for `private/` and `data/ats/` although `git check-ignore` shows both ignored | False warnings from `scripts/manifest-check.mjs` text matching (`course/2026fa/submissions/meenuviji/recon/raw-output.txt`, "gitignore check"). Not fixed. |
| `npm run ats:scan -- --dry-run` makes live network calls (886 Databricks jobs fetched, `course/2026fa/submissions/meenuviji/recon/raw-output.txt`, "Phase 0 fixes") | Not part of this recipe or its tests. |
| Form D samples are mostly pooled funds and barely join | Funding is not a vote here (see above). |
| The scorer treats a missing `liveness`/`timeline` as 1.0 | G2 refuses the role before scoring. |
